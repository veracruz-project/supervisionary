//! # WASMI binding
//!
//! This module binds the kernel's runtime state to the WASMI execution engine
//! (an interpreter for Wasm code).  Note that this binding process is fairly
//! specific to WASMI, and if we were to implement another binding for e.g.
//! Wasmtime, we'd need another module to handle it.
