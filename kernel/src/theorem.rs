//! # HOL theorems
//!
//! Theorems are recursively-defined trees, constructed per the axioms and
//! inference rules of HOL.  Note that in Supervisionary, like most HOL
//! implementations, we do not store "full proofs" of a theorem.  Instead, we
//! ensure that theorems are correctly-constructed via checks in the functions
//! that implement our axioms and inference rules, and ensure that *only* those
//! functions can actually modify the kernel's theorem heap.  This means we do
//! not need to store "back pointers" to other theorem objects in our
//! representation of theorems, nor do we need any way of ascertaining whether a
//! theorem was constructed by using e.g. a conjunction introduction rules, as a
//! last step.  This simplifies the representation of theorems, somewhat, and
//! allows us to simply record a conclusion and a set of premisses, rather than
//! having a constructor for each primitive axiom/inference rule in the type.
//!
//! Note, however, that some operations on theorem do need to make reference to
//! the runtime heap of theorems, in the kernel's runtime state.  As a result,
//! most of the complex functionality around theorem object is elsewhere,
//! leaving only basic construction and manipulation functionality, here.
