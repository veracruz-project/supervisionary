//! # Error codes
//!
//! In most LCF-style proof assistants, errors are signalled via exceptions.  We
//! cannot use exceptions in Supervisionary, so we use error codes instead.
//! Note that the contents of this file must also be mirrored in untrusted
//! "prover-space", as it forms part of the system interface between kernel and
//! prover.
//!
//! Note: there is a bit of a design kludge in this file regarding dependencies,
//! as we're forced to either have an-almost false dependency on WASMI in this
//! crate to declare `ErrorCode` to be an instantiation of the `HostError`
//! crate.  The alternative is to have a duplicate copy of the `HostError` type
//! in the `wasmi-bindings` crate to work around the rules about trait
//! instantiations in Rust.
