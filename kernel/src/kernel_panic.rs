//! # Kernel panic messages
//!
//! The Supervisionary kernel has a number of failure modes: ordinarily a system
//! call will produce a defined error code in response to some recoverable
//! error.  For example, if passed a kernel handle that "dangles", and does not
//! point to any registered kernel object, the system call will abort and return
//! an appropriate error code back to untrusted "prover-space" code which called
//! it, diagnosing the issue.
//!
//! Unfortunately, however, there may be situations where some internal
//! invariant within the Supervisionary kernel fails: for example if any of our
//! internal heaps fail to be *inductive*, and contain an object which itself
//! points-to another object which does not exist in another kernel heap.  In
//! these cases, we have hit an internal kernel error, which is unrecoverable,
//! and must abort at runtime with a *kernel panic*.
//!
//! The messages in this module contain user-facing error messages that are
//! raised by the kernel when a kernel panic is encountered.
